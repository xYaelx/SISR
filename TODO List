SS trained nets:
* Real-ESRGAN | TODO, may not work on IRL images (trained on anime images)
https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN 

* MuCAN + LAPAR + Beby | TODO, implemented in Pytoch(!)
https://github.com/dvlab-research/Simple-SR

* DRRN-pytorch

1. Open GIT brunch - done
2. How to implement preceptual loss - what is the input and how to write the gradiends (check if there's a ready made) ->Tali
3. Take the ZSSR notebook and Understand what's missing in the ZSSR notebook from the paper->Omer
4. How to implenet Auto Encoder (ready made) ->Yaelley
5. Look on relevant data sets ->Yaelley
6. Use cases of internal training
